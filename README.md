# HackChallenge3
This weeks task is a little looser then previous challenges. We are giving a simple project brief. How you wish to interpret this brief and what you develop from it is up to you.

# The brief
Develop a simple event management system. This can take whatever form you like but some basic ideas are outlined below.

### The simplest option:
Write a web page or discord bot that allows users to enter the time that they will be at a preset event. Users can then find all the other people going to the event and the times that they will be there.

### The more complex option:
Have a system that allows admins to create events on the fly.

### The even more complex system:
Implement a full user login system. This could use discord to authenticate the accounts or could have it's own account system entirely. Users can be notified in some way when events are created and prompted to enter their availability.

# Technologies to use:
The user interaction for this task is up to you. The two easiest options would be to build this as either a web site or as a discord bot. For both of those writing in either Node.js or Python is probably easiest. But programming language choice is completely open. If you are attempting to build in either Node.js then  [express](https://expressjs.com/) is a good starting point. If you are working in python then [flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) is an equivalent options.
